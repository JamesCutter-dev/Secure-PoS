To launch the program proper, run the MainFrame Class.

The solution can also be ran from the EposMain Class, this provides a different model for navigating its functions

The project will initially ask you for a username and password when ran, this default login will be admin and password for now

Once you have launched the solution, you need to add some products into the system for them to be selected in the cart

The initial page allows you to enter a product ID, a product Name, Price, Quantity and a discount (if applicable). Enter these details for any number of products you desire to manage.

If any mistakes or made or you wish to remove a product, select the dropdown Menu and head to remove product or update product.

Update product will allow you to select a product to change the details of. Product IDs cannot be changed.

Once your inventory is allocated, navigate to the Cart. This menu will allow you to add products for purchase for a customer

Items can be added and removed from the cart.

Discounts can be applied on the bottom bar. Once the customer is happy with their selection, type in the payment received and the solution will calculate if there is any change due. Finally hit checkout to close the transaction and start the next one.
